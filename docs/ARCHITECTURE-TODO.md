# Architecture TODO

This document tracks technical decisions and implementation details. Items are organized by category with status indicators.

---

## Resolved Items

The following items have been completed or clarified:

- ~~**Import Order Enforcement**~~ — Resolved via `@import` chain (`styles.css` → `fixed-tokens.css` → `root-tokens.css`) + runtime `loadCSS()` for brand tokens
- ~~**Wire token @import chain**~~ — `head.html` loads `styles.css`, which imports `fixed-tokens.css`, which imports `root-tokens.css`
- ~~**Fix grey token conflict**~~ — Grey scale is explicit hand-picked values in `root-tokens.css`, not derived via `color-mix()`
- ~~**Fix --text-dark-3 reference**~~ — Resolved; points to `--color-grey-500` in `root-tokens.css`
- ~~**Alias legacy tokens**~~ — Legacy aliases (`--background-color`, `--text-color`, etc.) mapped to design tokens in `styles.css`
- ~~**Implement brand token loading**~~ — `loadEager()` in `scripts.js` dynamically loads `brands/{brand}/tokens.css` via `loadCSS()`
- ~~**Brand detection via AEM metadata**~~ — `site-resolver.js` `getCurrentBrand()` checks AEM page metadata first, URL path fallback for local dev
- ~~**Create brand setup docs**~~ — `docs/BRAND-SETUP-GUIDE.md` created
- ~~**Remove Redundant package-lock.json**~~ — Removed; added to `.gitignore`
- ~~**Remove Completed Migration Script**~~ — Removed `tools/migrate-blocks.js`
- ~~**Remove Dead Code Functions**~~ — Removed `_autolinkModals()` and `_handleSelection()`
- ~~**Create Missing Model Files for Header and Footer**~~ — Added `_header.json` and `_footer.json`
- ~~**Add Missing icon-close.svg**~~ — Added `icons/close.svg`
- ~~**Add Missing Block READMEs**~~ — Added READMEs for accordion, cards, form, hero, modal, search, tabs
- ~~**Clean Up .git/.COMMIT_EDITMSG.swp**~~ — Removed

## Design Token Management

### 1. Zombie Token Prevention
**Question**: What process prevents accumulation of unused tokens over time?

**Context**: As brands evolve and components change, some tokens may become orphaned. Without cleanup, the token surface area grows indefinitely.

**Options to Consider**:
- Automated static analysis to detect unused tokens
- Manual periodic audits during quarterly reviews
- Build warnings for unreferenced tokens
- Token deprecation lifecycle (warn → remove)

---

### 2. Token Documentation Tool
**Question**: How do designers and developers discover available tokens?

**Context**: Token schemas can grow large. Teams need efficient ways to browse, search, and understand token purposes.

**Options to Consider**:
- Auto-generated documentation from CSS custom properties
- Storybook integration with token previews
- Figma plugin showing live token values
- Searchable token catalog in project docs

---

### 3. Brand-Specific Variants
**Question**: Can blocks have variants that only appear for certain brands?

**Context**: Some brands may require unique block configurations not relevant to others.

**Options to Consider**:
- Filter variants in Universal Editor based on brand context
- Allow variant metadata to specify brand whitelist/blacklist
- Keep all variants global, document brand recommendations
- Use conditional CSS to hide variants per brand

---

### 4. --nav-height Not in Design Token System
**Question**: Should `--nav-height: 64px` be moved from `styles.css` to `root-tokens.css`?

**Context**: `--nav-height` is defined directly in `styles.css` rather than in the design token system. This means brands cannot override it via `tokens.css`.

**Recommendation**: Move to `root-tokens.css` so brands can customize nav height.

---

### 5. Font Sizes Not in Design Token System
**Question**: Should responsive font size tokens be moved into the design token system?

**Context**: Body and heading font sizes (`--body-font-size-m`, `--heading-font-size-xxl`, etc.) are defined in `styles.css` with responsive `@media` overrides at `900px`. They live outside the token chain and cannot be overridden by brand `tokens.css`.

**Options to Consider**:
- Move to `root-tokens.css` (brands could override base sizes)
- Keep in `styles.css` (responsive breakpoints are structural, not brand-specific)
- Split: base sizes in `root-tokens.css`, responsive rules in `styles.css`

---

### 6. lazy-styles.css Is Empty
**Question**: Should `lazy-styles.css` be populated or removed?

**Context**: `styles/lazy-styles.css` is loaded in `loadLazy()` but contains only a placeholder comment. It adds an unnecessary network request.

**Recommendation**: Either populate with below-the-fold styles or remove the `loadCSS()` call from `scripts.js`.

---

### 7. buildAutoBlocks() Is a Stub
**Question**: What auto-blocks should be implemented?

**Context**: `buildAutoBlocks()` in `scripts.js:66` contains only a `// TODO` comment. EDS auto-blocks typically handle things like auto-linking images to lightboxes or wrapping video URLs in embed blocks.

**Options to Consider**:
- Implement common auto-block patterns (video embeds, image lightboxes)
- Remove the stub if auto-blocks are not needed
- Document planned auto-block behavior

---

## Build & Performance

### 8. Bundle Splitting
**Question**: How are shared dependencies handled across blocks?

**Options to Consider**:
- Current state: EDS handles bundling automatically
- Evaluate if manual chunk splitting needed
- Monitor actual bundle sizes before optimizing
- Document shared utility patterns

---

### 9. Source Maps
**Question**: Are source maps generated for production debugging? Where stored?

**Options to Consider**:
- Generate source maps, upload to separate secure location
- Only generate for staging environment
- Use error tracking service with source map integration
- Document current EDS source map behavior

---

### 10. Build Artifact Storage
**Question**: Where are merged models and optimized assets stored between stages?

**Options to Consider**:
- EDS handles automatically via edge caching
- GitHub release artifacts for versioning
- Separate artifact storage service
- Document current EDS artifact lifecycle

---

## Universal Editor & Authoring

### 11. UE Preview Environment
**Question**: Does Universal Editor preview use production edge, staging, or local dev server?

**Current Assumption**: Preview uses branch-specific EDS preview URLs

**Validation Needed**: Document actual UE preview behavior

---

### 12. Variant Selection UI
**Question**: How do authors discover available variants when authoring blocks?

**Options to Consider**:
- Dropdown populated from component-models.json
- Documentation links in author interface
- Preview thumbnails of variant appearances
- Autocomplete suggestions

---

### 13. Metadata Validation Timing
**Question**: Are invalid metadata values caught at authoring time or runtime?

**Options to Consider**:
- JSON schema validation in Universal Editor
- Runtime validation with error logging
- Build-time validation in CI/CD
- Combination of authoring + runtime checks

---

### 14. UE Form Configuration
**Question**: Where are the Universal Editor forms for token authoring defined?

**Investigation Needed**: Document AEM Universal Editor form setup

---

## Testing & Quality

### 15. Zero Test Files Exist
**Question**: When will tests be written?

**Context**: Jest and Playwright are installed and configured in `package.json` but no test files exist anywhere outside `node_modules/`. The `pnpm test` command has nothing to run.

**Recommendation**: Prioritize writing tests for:
- `site-resolver.js` (brand detection logic)
- Block `decorate()` functions (core rendering)
- E2E smoke tests via Playwright (critical pages load)

---

### 16. Coverage Targets
**Question**: What unit test coverage percentage is required? Enforced in CI?

**Options to Consider**:
- 80% coverage target for all JavaScript
- 100% coverage for critical paths only
- No hard target, review-based quality gates
- Incremental improvement approach

---

### 17. E2E Test Scenarios
**Question**: What end-to-end tests are actually implemented?

**Context**: Playwright is available in package.json but no test files exist.

**Investigation Needed**:
- Document existing E2E tests
- Prioritize critical user journeys
- Define test data management strategy

---

### 18. Visual Regression Testing
**Question**: Is automated screenshot comparison implemented?

**Options to Consider**:
- Percy, Chromatic, or similar visual testing service
- Playwright screenshot assertions
- Manual visual QA only
- Implement for high-traffic pages first

---

### 19. Browser Support Matrix
**Question**: Which browsers and versions are officially supported?

**Current State**: `package.json` specifies `browserslist: "baseline widely available"` which targets browsers with broad support for modern features.

**Recommendation**: Document the specific browser/version matrix this resolves to and ensure all team members understand the support boundary.

---

### 20. Accessibility CI Automation
**Question**: Beyond linting, are axe-core tests automated in CI?

**Options to Consider**:
- Add axe-core to Playwright E2E tests
- Pa11y or similar CI runner

**Recommendation**: Define deployment policy:
- No deployments during peak booking hours
- Emergency hotfix exception process
- Advance notice requirements

---

## Security & Compliance

### 28. CSP Configuration
**Question**: Are the current Content Security Policy headers sufficient?

**Current State**: `head.html` includes a CSP `<meta>` tag with `move-to-http-header="true"`:
```
script-src 'nonce-aem' 'strict-dynamic' 'unsafe-inline' http: https:;
base-uri 'self'; object-src 'none';
```
